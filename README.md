# Personal-Homepage

This is the repository of my personal homepage where I gather and present information about various topics. 

## Instructions
1. Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```
2. Start Server
```
npm run start
```
3. Build
```
npm run build
```
4. Update gh-pages
The branch 'gh-pages' has a copy of /build and is used to deploy using github pages. Use the following command to automatically update it to reflect the build in main:
```
npm run deploy
```
5. Make sure the right domain is selected in **settings > pages**.
